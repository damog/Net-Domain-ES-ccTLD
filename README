    Net::Domain::ES::ccTLD - Lookup for country names given the TLD code
    (¡en Español!)

VERSION
    Version 0.01. ¡Se habla Español!

SYNOPSIS
    Lookup for a country name given the country code (ccTLD)... in Spanish.

     use Net::Domain::ES::ccTLD;

     my $country = find_name_by_cctld('mx')     # $country is 'México'
      or die "Couldn't find name.";

     my $neighbor = find_name_by_cctld('us);    # $neighbor is 'Estados Unidos'

EXPORT
  find_name_by_cctld
    It returns the Spanish name of the country code or undef if it can't
    find it.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is similar to Locales::Country::es in purpose, but this one
    does work (I tried that one and it was busted), I actively maintain it
    (because I use it for my work), the encoding is not messed up and it's
    based on the names under:

    You've been warned :)
